//It may seem redundant to pass these dependencies [openai, messageHandler, guildService] in through the constructor instead of doing a hard import,
//But this allows us to "stub" them out later for "unit testing" which by definition can only be dependent on one file. This is one area in which
//We still add boilerplate bullshit code for the sake of testing, while in most other cases you wouldn't change code for tests.
